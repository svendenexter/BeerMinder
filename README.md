# BeerMinder
BeerMinder is an application which uses machine learning and openCV to detect what beer you drank last night!
Let's say you drank lots of different beers with your friends last night and you kept the bottle caps.
You throw them on a pile, open the BeerMinder application and you make a picture, now beerminder says what you drank and how much per brand.
